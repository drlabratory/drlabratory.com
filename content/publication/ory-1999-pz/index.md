abstract: The fluorescent probe anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate binds to adipocyte
  lipid binding protein at a site that competes with normal physiological ligands,
  such as fatty acids. Binding to the protein is accompanied by a relatively large
  increase in fluorescent intensity. To correlate the major change in optical properties
  and to determine the mechanism of competitive inhibition with fatty acids, the crystal
  structure of the protein with the bound fluorophore has been determined. In addition,
  the thermodynamic contributions to the binding reaction have been studied by titration
  calorimetry. Because the binding site is in a relatively internal position, kinetic
  studies have also been carried out to determine k(on). The results indicate that
  binding is not accompanied by any major conformational change. However, the negatively
  charged sulfonate moiety is not positioned the same as the carboxylate of fatty
  acid ligands as determined in previous studies. Nonetheless, the binding reaction
  is still driven by enthalpic effects. As judged by the crystallographic structure,
  a significant amount of the surface of the fluorophore is no longer exposed to water
  in the bound state.
